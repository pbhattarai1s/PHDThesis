\section{Goals}
\label{sec:Analysis_Goals}

The primary goal of the analysis is to measure the differential cross-sections of the kinematic observables sensitive to the EWK $ZZ ( \rightarrow 4\ell) jj$ production mode. The differential cross-sections measured in the VBS-enhanced phase space are used in the precision study of the SM $ZZ ( \rightarrow 4\ell) jj$ process and to constrain the effects of BSM physics. For simpler re-interpretation in the future without ATLAS detector simulations, the differential cross-sections are measured at a particle level using an unfolding technique, which corrects the detector effects.

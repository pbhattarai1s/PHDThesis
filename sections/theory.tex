\label{sec:theory}

This chapter describes the theoretical framework of the experimental measurements discussed in this thesis. Section  \ref{sec:SM} introduces the SM of particle physics and concepts relevant to the thesis. Section \ref{sec:SM_Incomplete} discusses the outstanding problems with the Standard Model, thus, motivating the experimental measurement. Section \ref{sec:Pheno} discusses the phenomenology of the proton-proton collisions, and Section \ref{sec:EWKPheno} discusses the physics of two $Z$ bosons production in an association of two jets.
